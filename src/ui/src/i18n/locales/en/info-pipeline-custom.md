**Custom Pipeline**: Take Full Control of Your Model

The Custom pipeline puts you in the driver's seat, giving you complete control over the model building process. You decide exactly how your data is processed, which machine learning algorithm is used, and how the final model behaves.

### Here's how it works

#### Feature Engineering

Just like the other pipelines, you have the freedom to choose how your sensor data is transformed into meaningful features. This includes selecting digital signal processing techniques, feature extraction methods, and sampling strategies.

#### Select Your Algorithm

Choose from a variety of machine learning algorithms, each with its own strengths and characteristics. You can select the algorithm that best suits your specific task and data.

#### Fine-tune the Model

Adjust the parameters of your chosen algorithm to optimize its performance. This allows you to tailor the model to your exact needs and achieve the desired balance between accuracy and resource usage.

### Benefits of using the Custom Pipeline

#### Maximum Flexibility

You have complete control over every aspect of the model building process.

#### Deep Understanding

Gain a deeper understanding of how your model works and why it makes certain predictions.

#### Customization

Tailor the model to your specific application and hardware constraints.

#### Experimentation

Explore different algorithms and settings to find the optimal solution for your needs.

The feature extraction pipeline helps you understand and prepare your sensor data for analysis. It doesn't train a model itself, but it's a crucial first step in the process. Here's how it works:\nSelect the building blocks: You have the freedom to choose the components that make up your pipeline.

### This includes

#### Digital Signal Processing

Techniques to clean up and enhance your raw sensor data, like removing noise or isolating specific signals. Think of it like fine-tuning your radio to get a clear signal.

#### Feature Extraction

This is where you extract meaningful information from the processed data. Imagine calculating the average temperature from a series of readings, or identifying patterns in a sound wave.

#### Sampling Techniques

Control how data points are selected from your sensor stream. This helps manage the amount of data being processed and can be important for capturing key events.

#### Machine Learning Algorithms (for Feature Engineering)

You can even use some machine learning algorithms to help automatically create new, more informative features from your existing data. This can reveal hidden relationships and improve the accuracy of later modeling.

#### Fast iteration

The pipeline remembers the results of each step. This means you can quickly experiment with different settings and combinations without having to reprocess everything from scratch. It's like having a shortcut to test out different recipes for your data.

### By using the Feature Extraction Pipeline, you can

#### Visualize your data

See what your sensor data looks like after each processing step, helping you identify trends and anomalies.

#### Prepare data for modeling

Create the right inputs for training machine learning models later on.

#### Gain insights

Uncover hidden patterns and relationships in your data, even without a full-blown model.

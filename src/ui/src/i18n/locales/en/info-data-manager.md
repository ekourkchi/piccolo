What is a Segment?

A segment defines the location of an event within your sensor data file. It's visually represented as a transparent label on the graph of your sensor data.
By creating segments, you're essentially labeling specific parts of your data, making it easier to analyze and understand.

### Adding Segments

* At the top right corner of the opened file screen click the Create Segment button to start creating a segment.
* At the graph view of the file, click and drag your mouse over the area you want to label as an event. This will place a new segment in the file.
* Select the Label for the segment from the drop down menu. If you do not see the label you want, click the CREATE LABEL button to create a new label.
* Click Save to save the segment.

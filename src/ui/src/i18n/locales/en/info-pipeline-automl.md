**AutoML Pipeline**: Find the Best Model Automatically the AutoML pipeline takes the guesswork out of building machine learning models for your sensor data. You still have control over how your data is prepared, but SensiML's powerful algorithms handle the heavy lifting of finding the best model and settings.

### Here's how it works

#### Feature Engineering

Just like the Feature Extraction Pipeline, you choose how your raw sensor data is processed and transformed into meaningful features. This includes selecting digital signal processing techniques, feature extraction methods, and sampling strategies.

#### Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)

This is where the magic happens. SensiML's AutoML engine explores a vast array of machine learning algorithms and fine-tunes their parameters to find the optimal solution for your specific data and goals.

#### Balance Accuracy and Efficiency

You can guide the AutoML process by setting constraints on model size and complexity. This allows you to find the sweet spot between high accuracy and efficient resource usage. For example, you might discover that a slightly less accurate model uses significantly less memory and processing power, which is crucial for many embedded devices.

### Benefits of using the AutoML Pipeline

#### Save time and effort

No need to manually experiment with countless model types and settings.

#### Optimize for your needs

Find models that meet your accuracy requirements while staying within resource limits.

#### Discover new possibilities

AutoML can uncover surprising solutions and model architectures you might not have considered.
